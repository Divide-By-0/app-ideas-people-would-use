If you make any of these, let me know and I can credit you in contributors!
If you make them and they're open source, I will help post to relevant communities if you'd like!
Stay tuned -- this list will reach at least 100 ideas, as I have over 400 in my list (the majority of them patently riduculous).

### All Software

- A command line music theory program
- A collection of all large scale health studies for foods, ranked on a single number line of toxicity with error bars. Can scrape correlation/p values and error bars directly from papers.
- Resulting graphic should look like: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3523382/Medical_studies-05.0.png
- Remotely control your grandparents computer/phone with one link click that you can send them.
- Automatic haircut chooser -- input a picture, and based on aligning you to a celebrity with similar facial features, overlay celebrity hair on top of yours to find a new style or to show your barber.
- A creative startup name finder powered by baby names. Find meanings for baby babes, and make a site where you can input keywords your startup is about, and it will print resulting baby names with meanings with the highest keyword overlap (or min distance in the word embedding space).
- https://www.joinleelo.com/blog/how-we-came-up-with-the-name-leelo
- Another startup name generator - input 2+ keywords, then try all reasonable pairwise ship names till you reach an untaken name .com/.ai/.io/other top TLD
- A lightweight create-react-app for ML apps. This starter app would compile on first clone and run React, Tornado, and SQLAlchemy (easiest to do with Parcel). Would be nice to have a 'yarn deploy' or something that does a one click deploy to GCP/AWS as well.
- A program that takes your spotify playlist and converts it to another one of remixes of the same songs, to get some variety.
- A program that takes your spotify playlist and converts it to a clean version with the same songs, and removes it if it can't find any. Used to be able to listen to my playlists in the car with my parents.
- A tinder for songs -- plays the most commented 10 seconds of a song on soundcloud, and adds it to a playlist if you like it. Inspired by Soundsieve (https://github.com/wilzh40/SoundSieve) which is unfortunately dead.
- An actually good online red eye fixer.
- Search portal where you put in a dish and it says what percent of online recipes of that dish have nuts, maybe by country too. Done by scraping recipes with country of origin to determine what to avoid when allergic people eat that cuisine, and create an intuition about what allergens and dishes to avoid for a certain culture of restraunt.
- Rate your own affinity towards topics and get a ranked list of candidates that most aligned based on the wiki grid, like a buzzfeed quiz for local candidates.
  - Prefer to make this automated by building a scraping service for all candidates on ballotpedia comparing state senators etc. and scraping their beliefs from their speeches on youtube transcripts or personal links or twitter etc. Can also train on the wikipedia grid of candidate beliefs/policy votes. Perhaps this is not enough info on local leaders -- might require an embedding/LDA type approach to analyzing their public profile.
  - Existing solutions are lacking: isidewith (only for presidential race), voteredge (ugly), ballotpedia (no side by side or issues grid).
- Add your spotify and visualize spotify data insights. Existing apps show tables or list, but it's a small jump to display eyecandy plots instead, and will help with virality.
- Automatically make photos look good by aligning edge detection with rule of thirds. Perhaps as a Chrome extension that runs when you hit crop on a google photos image link?
- An extension where you could double click a citation # in a paper and it would automatically open the pdf from jstor or other ðŸ‘€ sources.
- Convert chat in messenger to lowercase automatically (for speech to text or bad autocorrect).
- Keyboard shortcut for automatically fixing spelling in Google Docs+.
- Make app that embeds paperswithcode.com implementations directly to test (not generally, but a select cool few ones).
- Wiki game with subreddits and sidebars.
- Take a pic of a wine stand and recommend wines by rating to price ratio.
- A chrome extension that goes through an Instacart/Amazon Fresh cart and finds them on an ingredient website and scraps the ingredients, and flags foods with bad ingredients like hydrogenated oils (preferably, I would see all foods flagged in Deep Nutrition by Cate Shanahan, and I'm sure she would blast your app to her 13K+ twitter followers).
- Nerve (like the movie) but to avoid the horror scenarios, all submitted new dares must be moderated for safety. Alternatively mix and match a reasonable list of locations and actions.
